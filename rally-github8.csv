INC4730666   DE5220   Collateral value and Loan Amount have different periods on Request XML,Travis Atkinson Oct 14After discussing this defect with Cullen and Aditya it will remain a defect rather than considered an enhancement because the LTV schedule in the request XML was not implemented to mimic how Credit Configurator structures the LTV periods.In the details below I will describe the issue and propose a solution that will both remedy the defect and also improve the information sent to Webrules.To illustrate the point parallel submissions were entered into Credit Configurator  413232  and FinanceConnect  B012940 . For both the CC and FC submissions the full Financed amount of 80000 is the LoanAmt in Period 1 of the LTV schedule. However the CollatVal’s are different. CC shows the CollatVal = 60722.41 which is actually the collateral value after one month of depreciation. Notice this matches the CollatVal for Period 2 of the FC submission. Also notice that CC CollatVal for Period 2 = FC CollatVal for Period 3 = 59535.82 and so forth.FinanceConnect shows the original Financed Amount of 80000 and the starting Collateral Value of 61909 in Period 1 of the LTV schedule. It is good that they are from the same point in time but they are actually the values at Period 0 not Period 1.The optimal solution from the perspective of Risk Analytics would be to have a Period 0 as the first entry in the LTV schedule that shows the original Financed Amount as LoanAmt and Collateral Value prior to any depreciation as CollatVal. All subsequent Periods would show the LoanAmt and CollatVal at the end of the Period. Hence the final entry in the LTV schedule would show the LoanAmt = 0.00 and the CollatVal at the time the loan obligation was met. For this example there would actually be 49 total entries in the LTV schedule of the request XML for Period 0 through Period 48 since it is a 48 month term of monthly installments.I have attached the full XML’s for reference.Travis Atkinson Oct 8This should really be classified as an enhancement rather than a defect because Alfa is setting up the LTV schedule in the request XML exactly as Credit Configurator currently does. That is for Period 1 the Loan Amount is the full loan amount at the beginning of month 1 of the term  Time 0  whereas the collateral value is at the end of month 1 of the term or after a full month of depreciation  Time 1 . The timing of values should be aligned to properly communicate the LTV at each period to Webrules. The ideal enhancement would have a Period 0 with the full loan amount and full collateral value. All subsequent periods would show aligned amortization of the loan amount and depreciation of the collateral value. ,adschiltz,,Finance Connect Support    Alfa
